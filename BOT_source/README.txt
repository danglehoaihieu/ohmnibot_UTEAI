Bot Source

Description:
There are 2 source for NativeJS and Ohmni_docker.
For Navtejs, add plugins turn off/on serial command, and custom "ohmni_ros.sh" bash script
For Ohmni_docker, add main program (communicate with ROS_client, control serial to use tb_node, tb_control)

Step:
- Ohmni_docker:
 1. Run docker by "ohmni_ros"
 2. Run main.py at home/ohmnidev/

Note:
 Because my team'Bot have some issue, so we can not create docker for this source
